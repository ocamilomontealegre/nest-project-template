## üëÄ Motivation

When we start creating some new service based on NestJS most often we just use the Nest cli for starting a new service that already give us some convention and structure for our project. This is a good starting point however I was missing a couple of interesting things that almost all services should have to be ready to deploy to production like fully dockerized, ensuring coding conventions...

For this reason I created this custom template for new services based on this framework, with everything I would like to have to start developing a service with the best practices but with a simple file structure so later developers can change to implement their logic.

Here we are not providing any specific architecture like hexagonal architecture or others, this is like a simple template where later we can customize and create the architecture we need.

## Project setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```
